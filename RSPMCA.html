      <li>Trace circles onto 1 sheet of parchment paper.</li>
      <li>
        Place your almond flour and powdered sugar in a food processor for about
        a minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites on medium-low until frothy. Increase speed to medium and
        beat for 2 minutes, and then, gradually add the granulated sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase speed to medium-high and beat until the batter becomes dense.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in pink food coloring until completely combined.</li>
      <li>
        Keep stirring until batter is smooth and forms a ribbon. Do not over
        mix!
      </li>
      <li>Pour into a large pastry bag fitted with a plastic coupler.</li>
      <li>
        Place a clean piece of parchment paper over the one with the circles and
        put them both on a large cookie sheet.
      </li>
      <li>Pipe batter to near the edge of the drawn circles.</li>
      <li>
        Gently pull out the circle sheet, place on another cookie sheet and
        cover with a fresh piece of parchment.
      </li>
      <li>Pipe 20 more. Let them dry for 15-30 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Bake at 350Â°F. for about 12 minutes. Let cool. Carefully remove the
        bottom piece of parchment from the cookie sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use another cookie and parchment sheet. Pipe the remaining 20 cookies.
