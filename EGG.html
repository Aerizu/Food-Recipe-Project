        in a large bowl, sift flour, sugar, and salt. Then add softened butter,
        and mix with your hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the egg yolks and add the 2 tablespoons of beaten yolk to the
        flour mixture. Bring together until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with plastic wrap and then refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until
        the dough is firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the custard filling, melt sugar and salt with hot water. Mix
        until dissolved then let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rest of the beaten egg yolk. Stir in sugar water and also
        evaporated milk, and stir everything together.
      </li>
      <li>Strain the filling to ensure no lumps. Chill in the refrigerator.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C.)</li>
      <li>
        Take the dough out and divide into 16 equal portions. Spray the tart pan
        with a light coating of oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take one portion of your dough and roll it into a ball and place in your
        tart shell.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the shell into the pan with your fingers. Try to make the wrapper
        uniform in thickness and avoid a thick bottom. Repeat to finish all.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the custard filling into the shells until it is about 80% full.
      </li>

        Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the surface becomes golden brown and a
        toothpick can stand in the egg tart.
      </li>

        Cool down for several minutes and then take the egg tarts out of the
        pan. Serve while still warm.
