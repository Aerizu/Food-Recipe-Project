    <h2 class="Pep">What are meringues?</h2>
    <p class="Pep">
      Meringue is a type of dessert or candy, often associated with Swiss,
      French, Polish and Italian cuisines, traditionally made from whipped egg
      whites and sugar, and occasionally an acidic ingredient such as lemon,
      vinegar, or cream of tartar.

      <li>
        Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat
        to 250 degrees F.
      </li>
      <li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>
        Beat the egg whites and salt with an electric mixer on medium-high speed
        in a large bowl until foamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat until soft peaks form.
        While beating, add the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold the top of a pastry bag fitted with a round tip over and down a few
        inches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a paintbrush in the food coloring. Starting inside the pastry tip,
        brush a stroke of food coloring from the tip to the top of the bag.
        Repeat with 3 more evenly spaced strokes.
      </li>
      <li>Fill the bag with the meringue</li>
      <li>
        Pipe 1-inch-diameter mounds of meringue spaced 1 inch apart onto the
        prepared baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until the meringues are no longer glossy and feel light and dry
        when picked up, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave the meringues in the oven, cooling, until they are completely dry
        inside, about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
