        <li>Combine whole milk, sweet condensed milk, and kosher salt in a closed container. Shake to combine. </li>
        <li>
          Place your almond flour and powdered sugar in a food processor for about
          a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat egg whites on medium-low until frothy. Increase speed to medium and
          beat for 2 minutes, and then, gradually add the granulated sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increase speed to medium-high and beat until the batter becomes dense.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in pink food coloring until completely combined.</li>
        <li>
          Keep stirring until batter is smooth and forms a ribbon. Do not over
          mix!
        </li>
        <li>Pour into a large pastry bag fitted with a plastic coupler.</li>
        <li>
          Place a clean piece of parchment paper over the one with the circles and
          put them both on a large cookie sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Pipe batter to near the edge of the drawn circles.</li>
        <li>
          Gently pull out the circle sheet, place on another cookie sheet and
          cover with a fresh piece of parchment.
        </li>
        <li>Pipe 20 more. Let them dry for 15-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Bake at 350°F. for about 12 minutes. Let cool. Carefully remove the
          bottom piece of parchment from the cookie sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use another cookie and parchment sheet. Pipe the remaining 20 cookies.
          Let them dry 15-30 minutes, then bake for 12 minutes. Let them cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, fill the cookies with seedless raspberry jam, and you're done!
          Enjoy!
